# Homework: Review key concepts for Friday's project

Read/review the information highlighted above.

Note *one* concept/fact for each concept and note it in the README in the designated location.

### JavaScript: Timing events
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp

NOTE A KEY CONCEPT HERE:SetInterval() and SetTimeOut() are similar but different. The SetTimeOut only executes the time function once while the SetInterval runs the function continously. ClearInterval/ClearTimeOut stops functions.


### Handling Events: 
Chapter 6 - JavaScript Book and/or https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events

NOTE A KEY CONCEPT HERE:preventDevault() stops an event by default, which is good for pausing a function if an input or a click was wrong.


### CSS Background Images: 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image

NOTE A KEY CONCEPT HERE:background-image is just a way to insert a picture as the background for the tag,class,or ID called. I can be used in a CSS file and/or HTML inside the <style> tag.
